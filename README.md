# 3D Radar Plugin
## Description
This plugin is essentially an ESP you would see in a FPS game. It was originally intended for POTD and BA, but surely has uses outside of those contexts. 

This plugin is not necessarily user friendly currently. This is a personal project so it is up to my own free time and willingness to support the plugin. Feel free to PR or open issues, though there are no garuntees I will look at them and or accept them.

## Installation
To use the plugin, please install the custom repository with the following link:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KangasZ/DalamudPluginRepository/main/plugin_repository.json`

Please do not include my projects in other custom repos like Aku API.

## Notice
This is distributed with the MIT license. I take absolutely no responsibility for what users do with the plugin.

Under no circumstance is this plugin designed to assist any PvP-centric modes. I will not condone nor support this activity.
